🧠 GAN Loss Comparison on MedMNIST
A Comparative Study of LS-GAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP for Medical Image Generation

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to compare three popular Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures on the MedMNIST dataset to analyze their effectiveness in generating realistic medical images.

We explore and evaluate the performance of:
🔹 LS-GAN (Least Squares GAN)
🔹 WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)
🔹 WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty)

🧪 Evaluation Metrics
We used a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics to compare models:

Metric	Description
- Inception Score (IS)	Evaluates quality and diversity of generated images
- Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)	Measures similarity between real and generated image distributions
- Visual Inspection	Side-by-side comparison of real vs generated outputs
- TensorBoard Logging	Tracks training loss, generator/discriminator trends, and sample generations
